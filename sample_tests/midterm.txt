A coffee shop offers some special deals for their coffee.  A regular coffee costs $2.00.  However,
military veterans can get coffee for $1.00.  Seniors (over age 65) can get coffee for $1.00.  All
students can get 20% off of the price of coffee, regardless of their military status or age.

Partition this into equivalence classes and write them down below.

An online toy store is offering a deal for the holidays.  Any order of $100.00 or more will get a
free teddy bear.  Any order of $1,000.00 or more will get a free tricycle, but no teddy bear.  Any order
of $10,000.00 or more will get a free tricycle and a teddy bear.  Any order not meeting these requirements
will get a free lollipop.

What are the boundary values?

Your company offers an exciting new product, "Fibonacci-as-a-service".  The customer
 emails your company a number n, and the company will email back with the nth Fibonacci
number (remember the Fibonacci sequence is [0, 1] and each additional number is the sum
of the previous two, e.g. [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...].  You are in charge of testing this and thinking
of test cases.

Include a description of the case as well as a (reasonable) expected value.

Write a base case:





Write an edge case:





Write a corner case:

For each of the following requirements, write down one reason why it is not a good requirement.

a. The system shall use a Hashmap to store all login attempts.





b. The system shall be extremely responsive.





c. Whenever the system retrieves an invalid name and birthdate for a user, it will be set to the default.





d. The system will run continuously and never have any downtime.

Develop a test plan (with three test cases) for a Collatz Conjecture Tester.

The Collatz Conjecture is that for any natural number n, if n is even, divide it by 2
(n = n * 2); if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 (n = 3n + 1).  Repeat the process with the
new number until 1 is reached (e.g., 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1).  The conjecture
is that every natural number subjected to this sequence will eventually reach 1;
this has been tested up to 5.764 x 10^18 but never proven.

Upon initial execution, the system shall prompt the user with the prompt:
"Enter number >" without the quotes.

After accepting input from the user, if the input is not a natural number (i.e., an
integer of value 1 or greater), then the system shall display "NOT A NATURAL NUMBER"
and exit.

If the input is a natural number, the system shall calculate the sequence according to the
rules of the Collatz conjecture, and display each iteration of the sequence on a separate line,
including the initial value input by the user.

Upon reaching the value 1, the system shall display the number of iterations required
to reach the value of 1 in parentheses ( "(" and ")" ) and exit immediately afterwards.

Sample Output:
Enter number > 5
5
16
8
4
2
1
(5)

For the following runs of these test cases, write what their status would be listed as.

a. The test case had an expected behavior of displaying 7. Instead, the system displayed 4.




b. The case had an expected behavior of display "FOO".  The system displayed "FOO".




c. The test case could not be executed because the functionality has not yet been developed.




d. The test case has the tester to do something impossible, such as press a button which does
   not exist and is not planned to be added to the system (because it is command line only).

After testing the Collatz Conjecture tester, several defects were found.  Write a defect
report using the template described in class to write a defect report for each.

a. The user entered 7.  The following output appeared: "NOT A NATURAL NUMBER".










b. The user entered -4.  The following output appeared:
-4
-2
-1
(-2)

 Suppose we have a function, int billify( int n), which has the following requirements:
If the value of n is less than 5, return 1.
If the value of n greater than or equal to 5, but less than 20, return 2.
If the value is 20 or greater, return 3.

Assume no integer overflows (MAXINT and MININT are infinity and -infinity).

Does the following function definition contain a defect?  Why or why not?

public class Bill {
  public int billify(int n) {
    int toReturn = 6;
    if (toReturn == 6) {
      toReturn++;
    } else {
      toReturn = 7;
    }
    if (toReturn > 0) {
    if (n - 5 < 0) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      if (n - 19 <= 0) {
        return 2;
      } else {
        return 3;
      }
    }
    return toReturn;
  }
}

Write three unit tests in JUnit for the billify function in the previous question,
each one testing a different equivalence class.
There is no need for writing out the import statements, but remember to include the
appropriate annotations.

but the user receives an error when he/she enters a negative number into the program.
Is this a defect?  Why or why not?

You are a user of the Rent-A-Cat platform.  However, you have noticed that there is some
functionality missing which you would really like.  Using the Connextra template discussed in class,
write out a user story for this missing functionality.

Write out one scenario for that user story, using the given/when/then template discussed in class.

You are testing software for a data repository for sale to a large hospital in the Pittsburgh region.  This
data repository must meet all sorts of legal and regulatory hurdles due to it storing confidential
patient data.  Although the hospital will buy it, it will be used primarily by doctors and nurses in the
system.  They will look up data for individual patients, and it will let them know what courses of action
have been taken in the past.  The development team is very large and has a project manager who
likes to keep a close eye on the project, which has been running a little late.  Due to this, developers are
staying late at work and eating lots of pizza, which is causing the janitor much grief since the garbage
cans are overflowing with pizza boxes.  They are also drinking much more coffee than normal, much to the
delight of the barista in the coffee shop next to the office (as the developers are generous tippers).

If the sale goes through, the financials of this company will improve markedly.  The CEO has remarked
several times that the success of the project is essential to the success of the company.  The CFO has
mentioned numerous times that without the revenue generated by the sale of this project, earnings
will dip below Wall Street expectations.

List five classes of stakeholder for this project, and what they are likely care about.
