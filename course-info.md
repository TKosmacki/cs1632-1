This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern
software testing and quality assurance. Although it will cover testing
theory, the emphasis is on providing practical skills in software
testing currently used in industry. To that end, it will cover: manual
and automated tests, test-driven and behavior-driven development,
performance testing, and understanding and developing a testing
process.

## Grading

* Mid-term Exam - 15%
* Final Exam - 15%
* Group Projects:
  * Deliverable 1 - 10%
  * Deliverable 2 - 15%
  * Deliverable 3 - 15%
  * Deliverable 4 - 10%
  * Final Deliverable - 15%
* Class Participation - 5%

Although you are not required to come to every class (as you can see, it's technically possible to get an A without ever showing up except for turning in papers and tests), it is strongly recommended that you do.  I also expect students to take an active part in discussions.  Attendance _will_ be taken for project days, and this will count towards class participation.

The following grading scale will be used.

Score  | Grade
-----: | ------------------------------
100-94 | A (A+ for extraordinary work)
93-91  | A-
90-88  | B+
87-84  | B
83-81  | B-
80-78  | C+
77-74  | C
73-71  | C-
70-68  | D+
67-64  | D
63-61  | D-
60-0   | F

All groups are expected to do their own work on the group project, but
are more than welcome to collaborate and ask questions with other
groups, the Internet, or other colleagues.

However, any student caught collaborating or cheating on an exam will
automatically receive a 0 (zero) for that exam, and may be penalized
more harshly based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.

The final exam will be cumulative.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final
grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies
in grading.

## Attendance

Lecture attendance is not required, but is STRONGLY recommended.
The instructor will try to ensure that all information on the exams
will be available via slides, but simply reading them may be
insufficient to understand the concepts thoroughly. 

Presence for the mid-term and final exam are REQUIRED.  They will be
individually re-scheduled only in the event of an emergency.  If you
are facing an emergency, please contact the instructor IMMEDIATELY (if
it is safe to do so, of course).  Failure to show up for an exam
without clearing it first with the instructor will result in a 0
(zero) for that exam.

## Group Project Details

Students will be grouped into groups of 2.  For the first four deliverables, 
groups will be assigned and will be different each time.  For the final 
deliverable, you can choose to work alone, or choose your own partner 
(who must, of course, also agree to work with you)

Students will perform the role of QA team on a project which can be selected either by themselves, or assigned by the instructor.  Although students can select to work on a different project, it must first be cleared with the instructor.  Additionally, it should be noted that the instructor and/or TA may not be able to help as much if you use a different project or language!    The group should check with the instructor as to the feasibility of
the particular project they are working on.  

* **Deliverable 1:** A test plan and traceability matrix
* **Deliverable 2:** Sufficient unit tests for a large subset of the
project's functionality.
* **Deliverable 3:** Sufficient automated acceptance tests for a web application.
* **Deliverable 4:** Performance testing of an application.
* **Final Deliverable:** Will vary based on the group.  See the Final Deliverable description for details of what is expected.

Deliverables must be handed in by close of class on the day that it is
due.  Late deliverables will NOT be accepted.

## Programming Language Selection

The instructor is open to groups using any programming language or
testing framework.  However, it is *strongly* recommended that it be done in
Java.  All of the tools discussed will be supported by the professor and TA. If your group decides to use another language, the instructor may not be able to help with problems specific to that language.

If you want to use Java but aren't a fan of Eclipse, information on setting up the [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/) with the required packages for this course can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/alexlafroscia/c6757de349b27e34eff6).
