# Grading Guidelines

The quality of your write-up can and will impact your grade.  For a perfect grade, I expect
professional quality on ALL aspects of your testing, including:

1. Proper grammar, punctuation, etc.
2. No commented-out code, UNLESS there is a specified reason for it, e.g.:
   * `// This doesn't work, but this is what I would do if I could...`
   * `// Uncomment the following line to run additional long-running tests)`

3. No inconsistent spacing/tabs/brace settings.  I don't care which you use, but make
    it consistent.
4. Good variable names, good coding style in general.

* **Perfect Score** - Absolutely no problems, working on a challenging system with excellent
   test coverage.  Tests and kinds of tests make perfect sense and are described well.
   Summary, testing concerns, and quality assessment are easy to read with no grammatical
   errors.
* **A** - Minor problems, working on a reasonable system with good test coverage.  Tests and
   kinds of tests are appropriate and described well.  Summary, testing concerns, and
   quality assessment have only minor issues.
* **B** - A few issues, but overall decent test coverage.  Tests and kinds of tests could have
     been better.  Summary, testing concerns, and quality assessment have a few issues.
* **C** - Test coverage is not good; many tests are repetitive or unnecessary.  Tests and kinds
      of tests are only vaguely appropriate.  Summary, testing concerns, and quality
      assessment have major issues.
* **D** - Test coverage is horrible; tests do not do what they say, there aren't enough of them,
     and are not described at all.  Summary, testing concerns, and quality assessment are
     filled with errors, grammatical and factual.
* **F** - Test coverage is basically nonexistent; tests are testing the wrong thing entirely
     (e.g. a "usability test" which only checks a math function repeatedly) or missing.
     Summary, testing concerns, and quality assessment are unreadable or missing
    entirely.
